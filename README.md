# What is this?

This is a python program that simulates a TLS handshake between a client and a server using cryptographic techniques like SHA256, DH Paramaters and Key generation and verifying server certificates.


# How to run this program?

1. Open your terminal and run ```python server.py```
2. Open another terminal and run ```python client.py```


This is totally a simple implementation of the TLS handshake. I've tried to color the print statements and include 1 line descriptions of what's happening in each step to understand better. If you think you can make it better, feel free to PR
